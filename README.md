The official repository for the Mumbling Kobolds mod pack! Feel free to contribute or fork it for your own project!



**IMPORTANT**

Make sure you disable vanilla bodies with Mumbling Kobolds. Tissue regeneration will most likely not work if it is active. Mumbling includes copies of the other raws in vanilla bodies.

**ADDED**

A totally fun!ctional kobold civ with some minor edits to give them a more primitive flavor without compromising gameplay. Kobolds differ from dwarves in some subtle and not so subtle ways. Kobold sites are called clans and are led by a clan chief who is succeeded by their heir. Additionally, they are more primitive compared to dwarves and lack access to steel.

A new goblin civ called the coblyns. Plays like dwarves but with a goblin twist. They cannot make steel but they can make bows and use evil creatures like beakdogs or trolls.

A brand new civilization known as the devils. They are a group of lesser demons who have escaped from the underworld. Finally free, they are dedicated to keeping their brethren locked underground for eternity so they may rule over creation.

A new curse that deities can use to transform someone into a horrific fiend, a monster driven by unending rage.

**KNOWN BUGS & PLACEHOLDERS**

Currently, several weapons have had their size changed, including pickaxes. This is a placeholder until small weapon graphics are functional. You can activate them by adding brackets [] around OBJECT:ITEM in item_mumbling.

Devils do not have their own sprites and use human ones currently. Art is not my speciality so I opted to use what was available.

Fiends currently use minotaur graphics as a placeholder.

**PATCHES/SMALL CHANGES INCLUDED**
Shaped boots, creatures should know to take off their shoes BEFORE trying to put on boots now.

Tissue regens, creatures will now be able to regrow hair and other sensible tissues. Dwarves shouldn't fear accidentally shaving their beards off permanently any longer.

Cave spider poison syndrome is no longer a lifelong issue. Weavers can finally pass a soberity test once or twice in their lifetime.
